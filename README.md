# Quantum Ecosystem with Evolutionary Optimization

## Overview
This project demonstrates a hybrid quantum–classical framework that models a dynamic ecosystem via parameterized quantum circuits and evolutionary optimization. It leverages Amazon Braket’s SDK to simulate complex species interactions, where quantum circuits encode population states and classical genetic algorithms optimize the parameters to achieve a balanced, nature-inspired outcome.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Simulation:**  
  Utilizes quantum circuits to represent species interactions and classical evolutionary algorithms to iteratively optimize quantum circuit parameters.

- **Nature-Inspired Optimization:**  
  Mimics natural evolutionary processes and ecological balance, drawing parallels with how ecosystems self-regulate and evolve in nature.

- **Advanced Noise Modeling & Error Mitigation:**  
  Incorporates realistic noise models and adaptive strategies, preparing the simulation for eventual deployment on near-term noisy quantum hardware.

- **Scalable Architecture:**  
  Easily extendable to incorporate additional species (qubits) or more intricate inter-species interactions, in line with Amazon’s scalable, cloud-based quantum computing vision.

## Importance to Amazon
- **Driving Innovation:**  
  This project aligns with Amazon’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of quantum computing by demonstrating a novel application that bridges quantum simulation and bio-inspired optimization.

- **Enhancing Hybrid Workflows:**  
  The integration of Amazon Braket with classical optimization routines illustrates practical, scalable hybrid workflows that are essential for real-world quantum applications.

- **Future-Ready Approach:**  
  By showcasing error mitigation, noise modeling, and dynamic optimization, this work lays the foundation for more robust, high-performance quantum simulations—a key area of interest for advancing quantum technologies.
